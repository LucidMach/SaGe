SAGE
(Safe-Gate)
A Face Recognition based Security System

What Is SAGE? 
Safe-gate is a security system which uses
CV to safeguard the entry to a room or a territory that needs to be protected.
It is an intelligent gate system, which does
security surveillance connected to the user’s device through a website (or)  application software.

How It Works?
			The surveillance camera placed is connected to an administrator device that records and recognizes the face of the guest who is using the entry and if the records of facial features analyzed by camera fit the information in server (or) if manually approved by the admin, then the door opens until the allowed person is entered and if a person is not recognized and yet tries to open it, an alarm with a face of the guest will be sent to the admin’s device.




Timeline:
	ProtoType 1: This prototype is just a simple surveillance system focused on the face recognition aspect rather than on the UI.
It would use an actual camera mounted on the door for surveillance.
This stage has no UI.
The back-end processing occurs on a processor in the door (or) in the control room [if present only needed for large scale application]
	
ProtoType 2: This prototype shifts its focus on the UI aspects of the project.
It would use the camera present in the phone of the user for surveillance.
The UI is through a website.
The website connects to the system database through a QR code
The back-end processing occurs on a processor in the door.

	




Prototype 3: The expected to be the finished version of the project.
It would use the camera present on the device for surveillance.
The UI is through an app.
The app connects, for the first-time to the system database through a QR code. which redirects to the camera in the device.
The back-end processing occurs inside the device.
